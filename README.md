## Introduction 

This is a practice project focused on applying Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to the problem of loan approval prediction. The project uses a synthetic dataset obtained from Kaggle that simulates real-world loan application data. Through exploratory data analysis and supervised classification models, the goal is to strengthen practical skills in data preprocessing, feature analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected from Kaggle.

- **Name:** Loan Approval Classifications Dataset  
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data

## Project Overview

The dataset contains applicant financial and demographic information used to predict loan approval status.

# Features Description
- **persion_age** : Age of persion 
- **persion_gender** : Gender of persion 
- **persion_education** : Education or degree  
- **persion_income** : Annual Income 
- **persion_emp_exp** : total employment years 
- **persion_home_ownership** : status (rent,owner,mortgage)
- **loan_amnt** : Amount of loan requested 
- **loan_intent** : Purpose of the loan 
- **loan_percent_income** : The percent of loan amount based on annual income 
- **cb_person_cred_hist_length** : length of credit history in years 
- **credit_score** : Credit score of person 
- **previous_loan_defaults_on_file** : Indicator of previous loan defaults 
- **loan_status** : Loan approval status. (0=rejected, 1=approved) 

## Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning classification models that can accurately predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant characteristics.
